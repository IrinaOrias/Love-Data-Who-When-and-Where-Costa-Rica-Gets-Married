## **Costa Rica Marriage Trends (2014–2021)**

**Full Excel-Based Data Analysis Project**

---

### **Summary**

In this project, I worked with real-world data on marriages in Costa Rica from 2014 to 2021. I used Excel to explore, clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset. The goal was to discover patterns related to age, location, seasonality, and marriage type (civil or religious). I built pivot tables, cleaned and structured the data, and designed dashboards to communicate key insights.

### **Why I Chose Excel for This Project**

I found it important to start with a full Excel project because Excel is one of the most commonly used tools in real-world data roles. Building this project from start to finish helped me practice how to explore, clean, and analyze data, and most importantly, how to communicate insights clearly. It shows that I can take a raw dataset, make sense of it, and deliver useful information through organized dashboards and visuals. It also shows attention to detail and the ability to work independently on a data question—all valuable skills in any data-driven role.

### **Project Steps**

#### **Step 1: Data Exploration (Initial Review)**

* Opened the dataset containing marriage records in Costa Rica from 2014 to 2021.
* Reviewed all available columns (e.g., age, gender, province, type of union, occupation, nationality, etc.).
* Identified the overall structure of the dataset and began exploring possible directions for analysis.

#### **Step 2: Unique Value Identification**

* Created a list of unique values per column to:

  * Detect inconsistent values (e.g., spelling variations like “Setiembre” instead of “Septiembre”).
  * Understand the full range of categories in each field (e.g., all provinces, types of marriage, occupations, etc.).

#### **Step 3: Data Cleaning**

* Standardized spelling of months and province names.
* Verified that age columns contained only numeric values within a realistic range.
* Handled potential outliers (e.g., extreme ages or unusual locations).
* Checked for duplicates or missing values where necessary.

#### **Step 4: Data Structuring for Analysis**

* Created new sheets to organize and filter data.
* Prepared cleaner data tables for use in pivot tables and visualizations.
* Created separate tabs for average age, marriage counts, and monthly trends.

#### **Step 5: Average Age Analysis by Gender**

* Built pivot tables using:

  * sexo_contrayente_1 and sexo_contrayente_2
  * Edad_matrimonio_contrayente_1 and Edad_matrimonio_contrayente_2
* Calculated average age at marriage for both men and women.

#### **Step 6: Geographic Distribution Analysis**

* Built pivot tables to analyze marriage counts by:

  * Province of residence
  * Province where the ceremony took place
* Identified regions with the highest number of marriages.

#### **Step 7: Seasonality Patterns**

* Created bar charts to track marriage trends by month and year.
* Identified seasonal patterns and highlighted December as a peak month.
* Considered cultural and weather-related reasons behind seasonality.

#### **Step 8: Final Insights and Visualization**

* Summarized the results in visual dashboards.
* Highlighted key metrics (KPIs), trends, and major discoveries.
* Made the file presentation-ready with clean formatting and charts.

### **Questions We Answered**

* What is the average age at marriage by gender?
* Which province has the highest number of marriages?
* Are there any seasonal patterns in marriages?
* Are there differences between civil and religious marriages across provinces?

---

### **General Conclusions**

* Women tend to marry at a younger age than men.
* San José is the province with the highest number of marriages.
* Religious marriages are more common in specific provinces, while civil marriages dominate in others.

### **One Big Finding**

There is a clear seasonal trend in marriage patterns. **December** stands out every year as the most popular month to get married in Costa Rica—likely due to **holidays, cultural traditions, or favorable weather conditions**.
