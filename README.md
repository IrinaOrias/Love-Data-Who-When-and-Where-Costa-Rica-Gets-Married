One Big Finding: 


Seasonality in Marriage Patterns
Marriage trends in Costa Rica show a clear seasonal pattern.
December is consistently the most popular month for weddings, likely due to:

Holidays & vacation periods (more time for celebrations).

Cultural traditions (preference for end-of-year ceremonies).

Favorable weather conditions for outdoor events.

This insight is valuable for wedding planners, venues, and businesses catering to the wedding industry, helping them optimize resources based on demand trends.
