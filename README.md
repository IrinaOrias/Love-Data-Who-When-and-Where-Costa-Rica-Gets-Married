### *Excel-Based Data Analysis Project*  
**By Irina Orias Mendoza**

##  **Project Overview**  
This project explores marriage data from Costa Rica between 2014 and 2021. Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the dataset to uncover patterns related to:

- Age at marriage  
- Geographic distribution  
- Marriage type (civil vs. religious)  
- Seasonal trends  

The goal was to strengthen my data analysis skills by turning raw records into useful insights using pivot tables, charts, and dashboards.

## ðŸ› **Why Excel**  
I chose Excel because itâ€™s one of the most widely used tools in data jobs. It allowed me to:

- Practice data cleaning without writing code  
- Learn how to explore and summarize data visually  
- Focus on developing analysis logic and storytelling  

This project shows that I can handle real-world data, work independently, and communicate results clearly.

##  **Steps I Followed**

### **1. Initial Exploration**  
- Reviewed all columns: age, gender, type of union, nationality, occupation, residence, and ceremony location  
- Wrote down potential questions for analysis  

### **2. Listing Unique Values**  
- Identified all distinct values per column  
- Caught typos (e.g., *Setiembre* vs. *Septiembre*)  
- Got an idea of categories like provinces and union types  

### **3. Cleaning the Data**  
- Standardized spelling for months and provinces  
- Ensured numeric values in age columns  
- Removed duplicates and unrealistic entries  
- Handled missing or strange outliers  

### **4. Organizing for Analysis**  
Created new sheets to organize clean tables for:  
- Average age analysis  
- Monthly trends  
- Province-level insights  

### **5. Analyzing Average Age at Marriage**  
- Used pivot tables to calculate average marriage age by gender  
- Found that women tend to marry at a younger age than men  

### **6. Mapping Marriages by Province**  
- Compared residence vs. ceremony locations  
- Highlighted that San JosÃ© had the highest number of marriages  

### **7. Seasonality Trends**  
- Created bar charts for monthly marriage counts across years  
- Discovered that December is consistently the most popular month  

### **8. Building Dashboards**  
- Pulled all tables and visuals into a clean summary dashboard  
- Included key stats, trends, and easy-to-read graphs
