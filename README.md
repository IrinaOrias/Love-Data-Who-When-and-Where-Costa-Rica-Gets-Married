Costa Rica Marriage Trends (2014–2021)
Excel-Based Data Analysis Project
By Irina Orias Mendoza

Project Overview
This project explores marriage data from Costa Rica between 2014 and 2021. Using Microsoft Excel, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the dataset to uncover patterns related to age, location, marriage type (civil or religious), and seasonal trends.

The main goal was to strengthen my data analysis skills and learn how to turn raw data into useful insights. I focused on creating organized pivot tables, clear charts, and summary dashboards that tell a story.

Why Excel
I chose Excel because it’s one of the most commonly used tools in real-world data work. It allowed me to build the project from start to finish without needing to code. This helped me practice how to clean and explore data, and most importantly, how to present findings in a clear and visual way.

This project shows I can work independently, pay attention to detail, and communicate insights using real data.

Data Source
The dataset comes from the Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Censos (INEC) in Costa Rica. It includes national marriage records from 2014 through 2021.

Steps I Followed

1. Initial Exploration
I opened the dataset and reviewed all available columns. These included gender, age, nationality, type of marriage, occupation, and province of both residence and ceremony. I started thinking about possible questions the data could help answer.

2. Listing Unique Values
I made a list of all the unique values in each column to:

Spot inconsistent spelling (like “Setiembre” vs. “Septiembre”)

Understand the variety of categories (e.g., all types of marriages, provinces, occupations)

3. Cleaning the Data
Before starting the analysis, I cleaned the dataset:

Fixed spelling inconsistencies

Verified that age columns contained only valid numbers

Removed duplicates and outliers

Checked for missing or incorrect values

4. Structuring for Analysis
I created new sheets in the Excel file to organize the data into smaller, cleaner tables. These were easier to use for pivot tables and visuals. I built separate sheets for average ages, marriage counts by year, and monthly patterns.

5. Analyzing Average Age at Marriage
I used pivot tables to calculate average marriage age for men and women, based on their recorded age at the time of marriage. The data showed that women usually marry at a younger age than men.

6. Mapping Marriages by Province
I looked at where people lived and where the ceremony took place. Using pivot tables and charts, I found that San José had the most marriages overall. I also compared civil vs. religious marriages by province.

7. Exploring Seasonality
I used bar charts to show how many marriages happened each month across the years. December was clearly the most popular month. I noted that this could be due to holiday traditions, end-of-year bonuses, or good weather.

8. Creating Dashboards
I built a summary dashboard to show all major findings. It includes:

Key statistics

Charts showing trends by month and year

Insights into geography and marriage type

Key Questions Answered

What is the average age at marriage by gender?

Which province has the most marriages?

Are there seasonal patterns in marriage?

Do civil and religious marriages differ by province?

Main Insights

Women generally marry younger than men

San José has the highest number of marriages

Marriage type varies by region—some provinces prefer civil, others religious

December is the most popular month for weddings every year

Final Thoughts
This was my first complete data project using real-world data. It gave me hands-on experience with every step of the analysis process—from cleaning and organizing to finding patterns and presenting results.

I learned a lot through this process and feel more confident working with Excel and data in general. I’m excited to keep learning and apply these skills to new tools and bigger datasets in the future.
